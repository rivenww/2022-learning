# Sample project

P.S. My project: [https://github.com/wrw1997/toh-pt-learning](https://github.com/wrw1997/toh-pt-learning)

I download the project of tier 5 in the _Angular.io_. There isn't a ready-made GitHub repository so I initial a git repository and push it to my own GitHub repo.



Also, I spend some time in using In-Memory-Service, take over the function of _mock-heroes.ts_.
