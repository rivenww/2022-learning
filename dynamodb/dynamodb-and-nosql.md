# DynamoDB and NoSQL

## Learn from AWS documentation

Nice doc
{% endembed %}



From the doc, I tried creating table, reading table, modifying table, etc. -- In CLI and management console.

_Generally speaking, the data stored in DynamoDB looks like JSON data. It also reminds me of Redis, cuz they both use key-value pairs to store structured data._

After experiencing the example in the doc, the Angular project _Tour of Hero_ remind me that I could replace the local mock http server with a Spring project, while take DynamoDB as its database.
